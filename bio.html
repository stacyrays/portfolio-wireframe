      <p>I'm a ux designer and software engineer. I currently work in San Francisco as a designer at a consulting agency. We take on top name tech company clients, that I unfortunately can't list here. But they are huge, I promise, and they need our consulting help, so they hire us to help them. </p>
        <p>My undergraduate degree is in design and computer science (Purdue University). To brush up on the latest technologies and to get more experience in coding I am currently completing a fullstack javascript bootcamp for software engineering at Thinkful. </p>
        <p>When I'm not coding or designing, I love to take my dogs on hikes around the bay area, see the latest sci-fi movies, play guitar with buddies, and practice yoga.</p>
